# EcoTech
The problem statement is to Develop an AI ecosystem that captures, processes, and analyzes diverse environmental data encompassing air quality, water pollution, deforestation rates, and climate patterns. The system should furnish real-time insights and visualizations for a comprehensive grasp of the environment's present state.

**Solution**

This solution contains the Machine learning algorithms to predict the water and air quality with the pollutions

Description:
    
    The Frontend is developed using HTML and CSS . The backend is developed using Python ML model. Frontend and backend were connected using flask. ML model created for air quality prediction is using the Linear regression, for water quality prediction Decision tree is used.
